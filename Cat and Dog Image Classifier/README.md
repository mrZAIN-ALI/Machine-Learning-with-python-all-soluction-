# Cat and Dog Image Classification using CNN

This repository contains a solution to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. The model is trained to achieve at least 63% accuracy on the validation set, with the potential to reach 70% for extra credit.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
cats_and_dogs
|__ train:
    |______ cats: [cat.0.jpg, cat.1.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.0.jpg, dog.1.jpg ...]
|__ validation:
    |______ cats: [cat.2000.jpg, cat.2001.jpg ...]
    |______ dogs: [dog.2000.jpg, dog.2001.jpg ...]
|__ test: [1.jpg, 2.jpg ...]
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

- TensorFlow 2.0
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

### Data

The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training and validation sets contain labeled images, while the test set contains unlabeled images.

### Model Architecture

The model is built using a CNN with the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the feature maps.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the images into cats or dogs.
4. **Output Layer**: Sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

### Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will load the data, preprocess it, and train the CNN on the training set. The model will then be evaluated on the validation set.

### Testing

To test the model on the test set, use the following command:

```bash
python test_model.py
```

This will classify the unlabeled images in the test set and output the predictions.

### Results

The model is expected to achieve at least 63% accuracy on the validation set. For extra credit, try to optimize the model to reach 70% accuracy.

### Notes

- Ensure that the dataset is properly structured as shown above.
- The model architecture can be adjusted in the `train_model.py` script to improve performance.
