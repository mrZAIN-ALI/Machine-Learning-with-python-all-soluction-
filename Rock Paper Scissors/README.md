# Rock, Paper, Scissors Bot (Soultion)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) bot that aims to win at least 60% of games against four different bots. The challenge is to create a strategy that adapts to the opponent's moves to maximize the win rate.

## Project Structure

- `RPS.py`: The main file where the `player` function is implemented. This function determines the bot's next move based on the opponent's previous moves.
- `RPS_game.py`: Contains the game logic and predefined bots that the player will face.
- `main.py`: A script to test and play games against the different bots.
- `test_module.py`: Unit tests to ensure the bot's performance meets the challenge requirements.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-bot.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors-bot
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
   ```

## Usage

You can test the bot by running `main.py`. This script allows you to pit your `player` function against the different bots provided.

To play a game against the `quincy` bot with verbose output:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will simulate a match of 1000 games between your bot and the `quincy` bot, displaying the outcome of each game.

## Testing

To run the unit tests and ensure your bot meets the challenge requirements, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_module.py
```

Alternatively, you can uncomment the last line in `main.py` to automatically run the tests when executing the script.
