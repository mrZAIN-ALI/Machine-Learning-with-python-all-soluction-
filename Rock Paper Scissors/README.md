Project Structure
RPS.py: The main file where the player function is implemented. This function determines the bot's next move based on the opponent's previous moves.
RPS_game.py: Contains the game logic and predefined bots that the player will face.
main.py: A script to test and play games against the different bots.
test_module.py: Unit tests to ensure the bot's performance meets the challenge requirements.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-bot.git
cd rock-paper-scissors-bot
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies (if any):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
Usage
You can test the bot by running main.py. This script allows you to pit your player function against the different bots provided.

To play a game against the quincy bot with verbose output:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will simulate a match of 1000 games between your bot and the quincy bot, displaying the outcome of each game.

Testing
To run the unit tests and ensure your bot meets the challenge requirements, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest test_module.py
Alternatively, you can uncomment the last line in main.py to automatically run the tests when executing the script.
